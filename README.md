# Lost in Thailand | Milestone Project 2

The website aims to provide an insight to Thailand and the many places and activities it has to offer. The website provides three catagory sections where users can find information based on their needs. It aims to appeal to tourists who are interested in cultural sights in temples of which there are hundreds of locations to choose from. The website offers the top locations which are based on personal experience of the country and sights as well as top rated locations on google. The second catagory is for those who are seeking the best beaches to visit if they are looking for sun sand and sea. This aims to provide the best locations for all types of people. Whether they are searching for a quiet place to relax or if they are looking for the best beach locations which offer party goers the best mix of a beach holdiay and nightlife. The third ctatagory provides an insight to activities which adds an experience to remmeber, the experiences include interaction with exotic animals such as elephants and tigers via sanctuaries which have been set up for rescued animals. This goes against any exploitation of animals and provides an experience which is truly humbling. In conclusion the website tries to provide information to all kinds of users what ever their need may be. The information is laid out with images and text and via map location, it gives the user access to then seek further information either via the contact form or via links to external sites. 


## UX

## Design 

* Colour Scheme

    * The colour scheme is very basic through out the website to keep things simple and efficient. The main cover image is very light and shows a warm beach location witht he traditional fishtale boat. Image provided by myself on my journey to thailand. The main colours are white, blue and red with very light shades to provide a simple and clean feel. 

* Typography 

    * I have used the Lato font throughout for it's simplicity and clean look. It is voted the easiest text to read. The fallback font is sans serif as again it is one of the most common fonts and is easy to read. 

* Imagery 

    * The imagery is key to any site being effective. I have chosen to use both my own images from my trip and experiences in thailand and also professional images taken from sites such as freepik. I have tried to use as little effects as possible for the images that are my own, this is so people can see the place for how it truly is without any filters. The images need to be warm and welcoming, I have chosen my own picture of the fishtale boats as this is iconic of thailand. The picture of the docked boats in clear sea water automatically draw people in to see more. I chose this image for the banner image for this reason. 

* Wireframes



## Design 

### Existing Features

* The home page has a transparent navbar which links to three separate places within the same page. The site is a one page site which has all the needed sections connected to the navbar. This will be a sticky navbar which will change background color on scroll to aid visibility. In all this is to provide the user with ease of access and have the option of navigation at all times. 

* The brand image which is a three letter logo will be also linked to the top of the page for easier navigation to save time on scrolling.

* The site includes three main sections under the nav link places. Here the user will see three large buttons/tabs clearly marked and outlined for the user to navigate through the different sections.

* The user is able to switch between three different catagories and this will replace the content under each catagory rather than filling the page with too much text and images. The user can easily navigate the three catagories at any point.

* The site has a contact form for users to submit message requests for further information.

* The site has a tab list that the user will be able to select different sections via the links which will replace the current content and display the content they have selected.

* The site includes a maps API which will show the user the location of the place they are looking at. They will be able to use this to navigate and plan their holidays. 

* The site includes a footer with contact information and also clickable links to social media. 

### Features to Implement

*  The site has a contact form which is linked to an email API, this will allow users to be able to successfully fill out the contact form and send it to the site owner. The API will then send the relevant information back to the owner for them to process.
