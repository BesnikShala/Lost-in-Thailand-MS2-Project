                    <h2>The Sanctuary of Truth</h2>
                    <p> There are thousands of temples accross Thailand, hwoever to visit every single one in one trip
                        would be impossible. We have provided our most recommended temples to visit to get the best
                        experience. Here we show you the number one must see place which is The Sanctuary of Truth. This
                        is based on our opinion and on ersonal experience. The Sanctuary as can be seen in the photo
                        below is completely covered in carved wooden sculpures which are all done by hand on site. The
                        wood is continuously replenished as it weathers and wears over time. It is a beautiful site to
                        see from the outside but internally it is even more rewarding. The temple houses what seems to
                        be an endless suplly of detail which you cannot get enough of. This is not a place you can walk
                        in and out of within 5 minutes. The place is mesmorizing and enters as our most recommended
                        temple to visit.

                <div class="col-md col-sm-12">
                    <h2>Bamboo Island Beach</h2>
                    <p>Thailand is famous for it's beaches and which have featured in many films such as 'The Beach' with Leonardo Dicaprio. 
                       Situated inbetween Krabi and the Phi Phi Islands, Bamboo Island is only accessible by boat.
                       However this hidden gem is worth the trip. The island is very simple and does not have any
                       restaurants or cafes, this is the place to go if you want a taste of paradise. The island is
                       almost untouched which means the water is crystal clear, the sand is silky smoothe. This magical
                       place has entered our number one spot in the top beaches to visit for its beauty and simplicity!

                    <h2>Elephant Sanctuary</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many activities to do in Thailand, with many of them being offered on the coast from
                        Bungee jumping, jetsking, parasailing and many more. However this is not our most recommended
                        activity to do whilst in Thailand. The Elephant Sanctuary in Phuket which houses rescued
                        elephants is one the most humbling and jaw dropping experiences. You have the opertunity to
                        interact with elephants here and takes pictures, feed them and bathe them. This experience is
                        life chaging and one you will never forget, we recommend this as a must when in Thailand!
